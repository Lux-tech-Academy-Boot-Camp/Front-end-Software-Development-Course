 ## **LuxTech Academy Full Stack Web Development Course.** 


 This will be a comprehesive course, where we will handle frontend and backend software development. 


Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly. The challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and techniques used to create the front end of a website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is developing.


The objective of designing a site is to ensure that when the users open up the site they see the information in a format that is easy to read and relevant. This is further complicated by the fact that users now use a large variety of devices with varying screen sizes and resolutions thus forcing the designer to take into consideration these aspects when designing the site. They need to ensure that their site comes up correctly in different browsers (cross-browser), different operating systems (cross-platform) and different devices (cross-device), which requires careful planning on the side of the developer.

A **front-end developer** architects and develops websites and web applications using web technologies (i.e., HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), which typically runs on the Open Web Platform or acts as compilation input for non-web platform environments (i.e., React Native).

A person enters into the field of front-end development by learning to build a website or web application which relies on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and commonly runs in a web browser but can also run in a headless browser, WebView, or as compilation input for a native runtime environment. 

**We will oosely strive to follow the process outlined below:**

- Learn, roughly, how the web platform works. Make sure we know the "what" and "where" of HTML, CSS, DOM, JavaScript, Domains, DNS, URLs, HTTP, browsers, and servers/hosting. We won't dive deep on anything just yet, we will just aim to understand the parts at play and how they loosely fit together and start by building simple web pages.

- Learn HTML

- Learn CSS

- Learn JavaScript

- Learn DOM

- Learn the fundamentals of user interface design (i.e. UI patterns, interaction design, user experience design, and usability).

- Learn CLI/command line

- Learn the practice of software engineering (i.e., Application design/architecture, templates, Git, testing, monitoring, automating, code quality, development methodologies).

- Get opinionated and customize your tool box with whatever makes sense to your brain (e.g. Webpack, React, and Mobx).

- Learn Node.js 


**Note we will follow Lux Tech Academy philosophy:**

**Learning the actual underlying technologies, before learning abstractions.**

- Don't learn jQuery, learn the DOM.
- Don't learn SASS, learn CSS. 
- Don't learn JSX, learn HTML. 
- Don't learn TypeScript, learn JavaScript.
- Don't learn Handlebars, learn JavaScript ES6 templates.
- Don't just use Bootstrap, learn UI patterns. 


### **Potential Front-end Developer Skills.**

**The following core web technologies are employed by front-end developers:**

- Hyper Text Markup Language (aka HTML)

- Cascading Style Sheets (aka CSS)

- Uniform Resource Locators (aka URLs)

- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (aka HTTP)

- JavaScript Programming Language (aka ECMAScript 262)

- JavaScript Object Notation (aka JSON)

- Document Object Model (aka DOM)

- Web APIs (aka HTML5 and friends or Browser APIs)

- Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (aka WCAG) & Accessible Rich Internet Applications (aka ARIA) 


**1). Hyper Text Markup Language (aka HTML)**

HyperText Markup Language, commonly referred to as HTML, is the standard markup language used to create web pages. Web browsers can read HTML files and render them into visible or audible web pages. HTML describes the structure of a website semantically along with cues for presentation, making it a markup language, rather than a programming language. 


**2). Cascading Style Sheets (aka CSS)** 

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language. Although most often used to change the style of web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any kind of XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL. Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applications. 


**3). Hypertext Transfer Protocol (aka HTTP)** 

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web. 


**4). uniform resource locator (aka URL)** 

A uniform resource locator (URL) (also called a web address) is a reference to a resource that specifies the location of the resource on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it. A URL is a specific type of uniform resource identifier (URI), although many people use the two terms interchangeably. A URL implies the means to access an indicated resource, which is not true of every URI. URLs occur most commonly to reference web pages (http), but are also used for file transfer (ftp), email (mailto), database access (JDBC), and many other applications. 


**5). Document Object Model (aka DOM)** 

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform and language-independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML, XHTML, and XML documents. The nodes of every document are organized in a tree structure, called the DOM tree. Objects in the DOM tree may be addressed and manipulated by using methods on the objects. The public interface of a DOM is specified in its application programming interface (API). 


**6). JavaScript Programming Language (aka ECMAScript 262)**

JavaScript is a high level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language. It has been standardized in the ECMAScript language specification. Alongside HTML and CSS, it is one of the three essential technologies of World Wide Web content production; the majority of websites employ it and it is supported by all modern web browsers without plug-ins. JavaScript is prototype-based with first-class functions, making it a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles. It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates and regular expressions, but does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded. 


**7). Web APIs (aka HTML5 and friends)**

When writing code for the Web using JavaScript, there are a great many APIs available. Below is a list of all the interfaces (that is, types of objects) that you may be able to use while developing your Web app or site. 

**8). JavaScript Object Notation (aka JSON)**

It is the primary data format used for asynchronous browser/server communication (AJAJ), largely replacing XML (used by AJAX). Although originally derived from the JavaScript scripting language, JSON is a language-independent data format. Code for parsing and generating JSON data is readily available in many programming languages. The JSON format was originally specified by Douglas Crockford. It is currently described by two competing standards, RFC 7159 and ECMA-404. The ECMA standard is minimal, describing only the allowed grammar syntax, whereas the RFC also provides some semantic and security considerations. The official Internet media type for JSON is application/json. The JSON filename extension is .json.  


**9). Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (aka WCAG) & Accessible Rich Internet Applications (aka ARIA)**
Accessibility refers to the design of products, devices, services, or environments for people with disabilities. The concept of accessible design ensures both “direct access” (i.e., unassisted) and "indirect access" meaning compatibility with a person's assistive technology (for example, computer screen readers). 


**10). Domain Name System (DNS)**
The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical distributed naming system for computers, services, or any resource connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. Most prominently, it translates domain names, which can be easily memorized by humans, to the numerical IP addresses needed for the purpose of computer services and devices worldwide. The Domain Name System is an essential component of the functionality of most Internet services because it is the Internet's primary directory service. 

**11). Search engine optimization (SEO)**
Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of affecting the visibility of a website or a web page in a search engine's unpaid results — often referred to as "natural," "organic," or "earned" results. In general, the earlier (or higher ranked on the search results page), and more frequently a site appears in the search results list, the more visitors it will receive from the search engine's users. SEO may target different kinds of search, including image search, local search, video search, academic search, news search and industry-specific vertical search engines.
