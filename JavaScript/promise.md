## **JavaScript Promises.**


> "Imagine you are a kid. Your mom promises you that she’ll get you a new phone next week.”

You don’t know if you will get that phone until next week. Your mom can really buy you a brand new phone, or she doesn’t.


That is a promise. A promise has three states. 

**They are:**

1). Pending: You don’t know if you will get that phone

2). Fulfilled: Mom is happy, she buys you a brand new phone

3). Rejected: Mom is unhappy, she doesn’t buy you a phone
