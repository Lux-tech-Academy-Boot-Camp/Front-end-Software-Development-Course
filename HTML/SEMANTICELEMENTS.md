## **Semantic HTML5 Elements.**

Semantic HTML elements are those that clearly describe their meaning in a human and machine readable way. 


HTML was originally created as a markup language to describe documents on the early internet. As the internet grew and was adopted by more people, its needs changed. 

Where the internet was originally intended for sharing scientific documents, now people wanted to share other things as well. Very quickly, people started wanting to make the web look nicer. 

As HTML5 is still relatively new, this use of non-semantic elements is still very common on websites today.

- ```<article> ```
- ```<aside>```
- ```<details>```
- ```<figcaption>```
- ```<figure>```
- ```<footer>```
- ```<header>```
- ```<main>```
- ```<mark>```
- ```<nav>```
- ```<section>```
- ```<summary>```
- ```<time>``` 


Elements such as ```<header>```, ```<nav>```, ```<section>```, ```<article>```, ```<aside>```, and ```<footer>``` act more or less like ```<div>``` elements. They group other elements together into page sections. However where a ```<div>``` tag could contain any type of information, it is easy to identify what sort of information would go in a semantic ```<header>``` region.
