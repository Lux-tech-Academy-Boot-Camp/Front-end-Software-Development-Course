In this course we will be using HTML5.
 
HyperText Markup Language (aka HTML) is where the magic of web page design begins. HyperText Markup Language is a simple, elegant way to structure content. 

**Quick notes:**

- HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
- HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
- HTML describes the structure of a Web page
- HTML consists of a series of elements
- HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
- HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc. 

Example of a HTML document. 

```html 

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
``` 

The first line on the top, ```html <!DOCTYPE html> ```, is a document type declaration and it lets the browser know which flavor of HTML you’re using (HTML5, in this case). It’s very important to stick this in - If you don’t, browsers will assume you don’t really know what you’re doing and act in a very peculiar way. 

To get back to the point, ```html <html> ``` is the opening tag that kicks things off and tells the browser that everything between that and the ```html </html> ``` closing tag is an HTML document. The stuff between ```html <body> ``` and ```html </body> ``` is the main content of the document that will appear in the browser window.
