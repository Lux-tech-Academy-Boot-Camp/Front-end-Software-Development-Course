## **Advanced CSS Topics.**  

### **Shadows.** 

#### **-Box Shadows**

box-shadow is the standard CSS property to get you going and it can have a value comprising several parts as shown in the example below

```css
box-shadow: 5px 5px 3px 1px #999
``` 

- **The first value is the horizontal offset**
     => how far the shadow is nudged to the right (or left if it’s negative)

- **The second value is the vertical offset**
    =>  how far the shadow is nudged downwards (or upwards if it’s negative)

- **The third value is the blur radius**
    => the higher the value the less sharp the shadow. (“0” being absolutely sharp). This is optional — omitting it is equivalent of setting “0”.

- **The fourth value is the spread distance.** 
     => the higher the value, the larger the shadow (“0” being the inherited size of the box). This is also optional — omitting it is equivalent of setting “0”.

- **The fifth value is a color.** That’s optional, too.


####  **-Inner shadows.**

 - You can also apply shadows to the inside of a box by adding “inset” to the list.

 
 ```css
 box-shadow: inset 0 0 7px 5px #ddd;
 ```

#### **Text Shadows.**

 - box-shadow, as its name implies, only has eyes for boxes. Fickle beast. But you can also apply shadows to the outline of text with (surprise!) text-shadow.

 ```css
 text-shadow: -2px 2px 2px #999;
 ```

**Similarly to box-shadow:**

- The first value is the horizontal offset
- The second value is the vertical offset
- The third value is the blur radius (optional)
- The fourth value is the color (optional, although omitting this will make the shadow the same color as the text itself)

### **Media Queries**

@media at-rules are used to target styles at specific media, such as screen or print  etc ... 

**Example:**

```css
@media screen {

    body { font: 12px arial, sans-serif }
    #nav { display: block }

}

``` 


**You can also add browser-size specific media queries.** 

**Example:**

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 1000px) {

    #content { width: 100% }

}
``` 

**You can also add device-specific media queries.** 

**Example:** 

```css
@media screen and (min-device-height: 768px) and (max-device-width: 1024px) {

    /* You can apply numerous conditions separated by "and" */

} 
```
