## **Advanced CSS Topics.**  

### **Shadows.** 

#### **-Box Shadows**

box-shadow is the standard CSS property to get you going and it can have a value comprising several parts as shown in the example below

```css
box-shadow: 5px 5px 3px 1px #999
``` 

- **The first value is the horizontal offset**
     => how far the shadow is nudged to the right (or left if it’s negative)

- **The second value is the vertical offset**
    =>  how far the shadow is nudged downwards (or upwards if it’s negative)

- **The third value is the blur radius**
    => the higher the value the less sharp the shadow. (“0” being absolutely sharp). This is optional — omitting it is equivalent of setting “0”.

- **The fourth value is the spread distance.** 
     => the higher the value, the larger the shadow (“0” being the inherited size of the box). This is also optional — omitting it is equivalent of setting “0”.

- **The fifth value is a color.** That’s optional, too.


####  **-Inner shadows.**

 - You can also apply shadows to the inside of a box by adding “inset” to the list.

 
 ```css
 box-shadow: inset 0 0 7px 5px #ddd;
 ```

#### **Text Shadows.**

 - box-shadow, as its name implies, only has eyes for boxes. Fickle beast. But you can also apply shadows to the outline of text with (surprise!) text-shadow.

 ```css
 text-shadow: -2px 2px 2px #999;
 ```

**Similarly to box-shadow:**

- The first value is the horizontal offset
- The second value is the vertical offset
- The third value is the blur radius (optional)
- The fourth value is the color (optional, although omitting this will make the shadow the same color as the text itself)
