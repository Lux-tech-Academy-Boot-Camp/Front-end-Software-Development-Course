### **Class and ID Selectors**

In the CSS, a class selector is a name preceded by a full stop (“.”) and an ID selector is a name preceded by a hash character (“#”).

```css
/* ID selector in css */
#top {
    background-color: #ccc;
    padding: 20px
}

/* Class selector in CSS */
.intro {
    color: red;
    font-weight: bold;
} 

/* Additional selector style */

[text]{
	color: red;
    font-weight: bold;

}
``` 

#### **HTML5 Markdown being styles**

```html
<h1> Hello from header1 </h1> 
<h2> Hello from header2 </h2> 
<p> Hello from paragraph </p> 
```
